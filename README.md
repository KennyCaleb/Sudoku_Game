1. Animation Trigger Documentation
    1. Overview
    This documentation explains how to implement an animation that is triggered by a button click using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The example provided demonstrates a simple scaling animation applied to a button when it is clicked.

    2. HTML Structure - The HTML structure consists of a single button element that will trigger the animation when clicked.

    3. <button id="animated-button">Click me!</button>: The button element that, when clicked, will trigger the animation.

    4. CSS Styles - The CSS defines the animation and the class that will apply this animation to the button.

    5. .animated: A CSS class that applies the example-animation animation to an element.

    6. @keyframes example-animation: Defines the keyframes for the animation named example-animation. The animation scales the element from its original size to 1.1 times its size and back to its original size.

    7. JavaScript - The JavaScript code adds an event listener to the button to trigger the animation when clicked. It also ensures the animation can be retriggered by removing the animation class after the animation ends.

    8. const animatedButton = document.getElementById('animated-button');: Selects the button element with the ID animated-button.

    9. animatedButton.addEventListener('click', () => { ... });: Adds a click event listener to the button. When the button is clicked, it adds the animated class to the button.

    10. animatedButton.addEventListener('animationend', () => { ... }, { once: true });: Adds an event listener for the animationend event. This listener removes the animated class from the button once the animation ends, allowing the animation to be retriggered on subsequent clicks. The { once: true } option ensures that this event listener is removed after being executed once.

2. How It Works
    1. HTML Structure: The button with the ID animated-button is defined in the HTML.

    2. CSS Animation: The CSS defines a keyframe animation example-animation that scales the element up and then back to its original size. The .animated class applies this animation.

    3. JavaScript:
    The JavaScript selects the button element.
    It adds an event listener to trigger the animation by adding the animated class when the button is clicked.
    It also adds an event listener to remove the animated class after the animation ends, allowing the animation to be retriggered with subsequent clicks.

3. Usage
Setup: Ensure all three files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) are in the same directory.
Open in Browser: Open index.html in a web browser.
Interaction: Click the button to see the animation. The button will scale up and then back to its original size each time it is clicked.
